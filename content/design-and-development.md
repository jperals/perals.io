A lot is being written these days about the relationship between design and development and how our workflows can be improved. For quite some time we have been trying to "bridge the gap" between design phase and development phase with automated tools. But maybe we have been overrating the static design mockup as a _source of truth_.

After some years experimenting with tools that export code from visual design files, it's interesting how more and more tools are coming out that do it the other way around by exporting from code components to be used in visual design software. Some examples of this are [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/), [Alva](https://meetalva.io/) and the upcoming [Framer X](https://framer.com/announcement/).
