      <description>At IXDS I had the opportunity to contribute to top emerging design projects by helping make UX concepts tangible.
One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS was the close relationship between design and engineering —and one of its most challenging aspects was the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for mid-term development at the same time.</description>

      <description>Spex is a tool to help interdisciplinary teams be aligned on design ideas. As part of a research project at IXDS, we developed a functional MVP of Spex in 12 work days. &amp;nbsp;
 
The story view allows designers to create a user story for the design idea, as a sort of slide presentation. &amp;nbsp;
  At the same time, a more technical team member can use the system view to describe the components involved in the system and the relationships between them.</description>
