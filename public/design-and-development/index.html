<p>After some years experimenting with tools that export code from visual design files, it&rsquo;s interesting how more and more tools are coming out that do it the other way around by exporting from code components to be used in visual design software. Some examples of this are <a href="http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/">React Sketch.app</a>, <a href="https://meetalva.io/">Alva</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://framer.com/announcement/">Framer X</a>.</p>
