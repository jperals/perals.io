If you write code, it's important to remember that it is going to be read not just by computers but also by humans. If you just wrote something that _works_ in the sense that it runs as expected, but is not nice to read and not clear how to use and extend, it's _not_ ready.

Making code more readable is making it not only more maintainable and flexible but also more inclusive.

Having developed prototypes for years, this is a field where people underestimate the value of clean coding. "It's just a prototype!" But it's exactly the contrary: because your code needs to be open to unexpected changes at any time and also to fellow collaborators, it needs to be written in a way that is obvious, flexible and extendable.

Naming things clearly, organizing applications in components, following clear data flow patterns, letting frameworks help you, having refactoring habits, and of course maintain some human-friendly documentation, for example, become really important.
