Hugo is yet another static site generator, pretty much like Jekyll. I wouldn't say that build speed is the most important feature, but I have to admit that Hugo's is quite impressive. My site is still rather small, but a development build is generated in 19ms and a production build in 116ms. It often leaves me waiting until I realise it has already finished.

And also beyond the speed question, so far so good with Hugo.
