For some reason I thought Gatsby was a sort of static site generator more or less like Jekyll, but it turned out to be something different, more about reading external data sources than static content files â€”something that, even assuming it could somehow fit my specific needs, it would probably be much more complex to do so.

It was rather [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that I was looking for.
