By changing an `ai` file extension to `pdf`, it is possible to import its content into a Sketch document by dragging the file into it. Not sure if _all_ the information is kept, but at least the vector elements are there.

Interestingly, if the file extension was not changed, Sketch will just import the `ai` file as a raster image.
