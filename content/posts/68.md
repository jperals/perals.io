Last year I started a sort of basic markdown-based micro-blog just to jot down small software-related learnings. I hosted it on Heroku, which is free but sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity. That's OK for me as a user, but I would not want potential visitors to have to wait for the instance to wake up. At the same time, not sure it's worth paying for Django hosting just for such a minor project.
