<p>Hi!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a web developer and creative technologist with 10 years of professional experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some thoughts about:</p>

<h2 id="django">Django</h2>

<p>I find that <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> gives you all you need and no more. Out-of-the-box basic user management and content management, object-relational mapping, and a smart data migration system have you well covered on the backend, but you still have lots of freedom on the frontend.</p>

<h2 id="vue">Vue</h2>

<p>Its declarative, HTML-first syntax makes it so enjoyable, friendly and at the same time efficient to work with it. Just great.</p>

<h2 id="react">React</h2>

<p>Coming from Angular, React&rsquo;s syntax where everything is wrapped in JavaScript never seemed very attractive to me. But its big advantage is its huge tool ecosystem around.</p>

<h2 id="human-friendly-coding">Human-friendly coding</h2>

<p>If you write code, it&rsquo;s important to remember that it is going to be read not just by computers but also by humans. If you just wrote something that <em>works</em> (i.e, runs as expected) but that&rsquo;s unclear to read, that code is not ready, it needs more work.</p>

<p>Making code more readable is making it not only more maintainable and flexible but also more inclusive. We can think of programming languages and frameworks as design products that should have the aim to let us do as much as possible with as little effort as possible.</p>

<p>Having developed prototypes for years, this is a field where people underestimate the value of clean coding. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a prototype!&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s exactly the contrary: because your code needs to be open to unexpected changes at any time and also to fellow collaborators, it needs to be written in a way that is obvious, flexible and extendable.</p>

<p>Naming things clearly, organizing applications in components, following clear data flow patterns, letting frameworks help you, having refactoring habits, and of course maintain some human-friendly documentation are some things that can help.</p>

<h2 id="design-and-development">Design and development</h2>

<p>A lot is being written about the relationship between design and development these days. For quite some time we have been trying to &ldquo;fill the gap&rdquo; between design phase and development phase. But maybe we have been overrating the static design mockup as a <a href="#source-of-truth">source of truth</a>.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-send-files-the-single-source-of-truth-principle">Don&rsquo;t send files: The Single Source of Truth principle</h2>

<p>You send out the file with the texts to be translated. In the meantime, you develop new features, so you generate a new version of the translation file with more texts. But the old one is already being translated, and not in your power&hellip; What do you do?</p>

<p>Someone sends you the code over e-mail. You make a Git repo out of it. You do some changes to better fit your needs. After some time, you ask about something and are sent a <em>new version</em>, which conflicts with your changes.</p>

<p>How to solve this? You don&rsquo;t send files. You better use the Web to have a Single Source of Truth. If it&rsquo;s code, a reference Git repo is the obvious solution. For anything else, just find the right online tool.</p>
