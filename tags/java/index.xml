      <description>Big Bother (sic) is a generative sketch that features an eye on a large screen. This eye has the ability to mutate a little when it detects movement around: a new pupil appears to follow every “target”, with the aim to follow each watcher individually.
This piece was exhibited on a huge screen in the center of Madrid as part of MediaLab Prado’s #ProgramaLaPlaza contest in 2014.
 You can check and tweak the code here, and see other submitted projects here.</description>

      <description>Exploring diverse patterns in 2D particle systems, using Processing.
Garbuix (/gəɾβúʃ/) is the combination of a Processing sketch with a web-based user interface to explore visually interesting behaviours of 2D systems.
We have a set of points randomly distributed on a 2D plane. Just by combining a set of rules on the way in which they should move, interact with each other and be displayed, we can go through a rich and diverse set of visual experiences.</description>
