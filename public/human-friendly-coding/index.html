    Human-Friendly Coding

                <p>If you write code, it&rsquo;s important to remember that it is going to be read not just by computers but also by humans. If you just wrote something that <em>works</em> in the sense that it runs as expected, but is not nice to read and not clear how to use and extend, it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> ready.</p>

<p>Making code more readable is making it not only more maintainable and flexible but also more inclusive.</p>

<p>Having developed prototypes for years, this is a field where people underestimate the value of clean coding. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a prototype!&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s exactly the contrary: because your code needs to be open to unexpected changes at any time and also to fellow collaborators, it needs to be written in a way that is obvious, flexible and extendable.</p>

<p>Naming things clearly, organizing applications in components, following clear data flow patterns, letting frameworks help you, having refactoring habits, and of course maintain some human-friendly documentation, for example, become really important.</p>
