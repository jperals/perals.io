_Big Bother_ (sic) is a generative sketch that features an eye on a large screen. This eye has the ability to mutate a little when it detects movement around: a new pupil appears to follow every “target”, with the aim to follow each watcher individually.

This piece was exhibited on a huge screen in the center of Madrid as part of MediaLab Prado’s #ProgramaLaPlaza contest in 2014.
