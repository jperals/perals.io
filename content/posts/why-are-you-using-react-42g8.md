React is the most used library for frontend development these days, and I would like to better understand why that is. So if you use, have used or are planning to use React, I am curious to read from you what were/are the reasons to adopt it, for example:

- Do you find it better than others, and if so for what reason(s)?
- Because it is the most used?
- Others chose it for you?
- Compatibility with other tools?
- You didn't stop to think about alternatives?
- Other reasons?
