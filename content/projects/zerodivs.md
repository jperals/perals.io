As a web developer I strive to write code that is semantic and concise. And CSS is an often underrated hero that can help you avoid unnecessary scripts and markup. But â€”just how far can it go?

A number of people have explored how CSS can be used and abused and came up with many interesting ideas, but it was probably while trying to emulate Lynn Fischer's mind-blowing [single div illustrations](https://a.singlediv.com) and realizing how hard it actually is to code CSS illustrations by hand, that I felt the need to, well, maybe, make a visual editor?
