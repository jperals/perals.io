Coming from Angular, [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s syntax where everything is wrapped in JavaScript never seemed very attractive to me. But its big advantage is its huge tool ecosystem around.

For example, we can see interesting tools in the design/development toolset like [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/), [Alva](https://meetalva.io/) or [Framer X](https://framer.com/announcement/).

Also, interesting patterns have come out of its ecosystem, like Redux or GraphQL.
