For example, instead of just:

```
node .
```

You can do:

```
time node .
```

to get some basic extra execution time numbers without the need of extra performance calculations from your app's side.

On Mac OS, the output looks like this:

```
real    0m1.562s
user    0m1.544s
sys     0m0.167s
```

But it can vary among operative systems. More information for example on Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Unix))
