At IXDS I have the opportunity to contribute to top emerging design projects by helping _make UX concepts tangible_.

One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS is the close relationship between design and engineering —and one of its most challenging aspects is the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for mid-term development at the same time.
