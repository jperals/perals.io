    Don&#39;t Send Files

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>You send out the file with the texts to be translated. In the meantime, you develop new features, so you generate a new version of the translation file with more texts. But the old one is already being translated, and not in your power&hellip; Who merges the two files, when, and how?</p>

<p>Someone sends you the code over e-mail. You make a Git repo out of it, because you should. You do some changes to better fit your needs. After some time, you ask about something and are sent a <em>new version</em>, of course over e-mail again, with many unexpected changes which conflict with your changes in several ways, technically and concept-wise. Ouch.</p>

<p>How to solve this? Well, don&rsquo;t send files over, please. The Web to can help you establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">single source of truth</a> for collaborating. If it&rsquo;s about code, a reference Git repo is the obvious solution. For anything else, just find the right online tool.</p>
