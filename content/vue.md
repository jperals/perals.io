[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)'s declarative, HTML-first syntax makes it so enjoyable, friendly and at the same time efficient to work with it.

As Angular 2 was such a breaking change from Angular 1, the situation was a bit confusing for a time and brought me and my team to explore new tools. While React's "it's just JavaScript" approach makes it very flexible, Vue rather follows the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) by sticking closer to the HTML/templating mindset, which makes it most suitable and [inclusive](../human-friendly-coding) for web-inclined people.
