So apparently there are (at least) two ways to add a code block in Markdown: either by indentation (which I find less convenient), or by using the triple-backtick (```) method that I am already used to (Gitlab, Github, Slack, Trello...),. It seems that using triple tilde (~~~) may also be possible, at least in some implementations.

Markdown code blocks created with the triple backtick or triple tilde method are called "fenced code blocks".
