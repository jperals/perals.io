If you write code, it's important to remember that it is going to be read not just by computers but also by humans. If you just wrote something that _works_ (i.e, runs as expected) but that's unclear to read, that code is not ready, it needs more work.

Making code more readable is making it not only more maintainable and flexible but also more inclusive. We can think of programming languages and frameworks as design products that should have the aim to let us do as much as possible with as little effort as possible.

Having developed prototypes for years, this is a field where people underestimate the value of clean coding. "It's just a prototype!" But it's exactly the contrary: because your code needs to be open to unexpected changes at any time and also to fellow collaborators, it needs to be written in a way that is obvious, flexible and extendable.

Naming things clearly, organizing applications in components, following clear data flow patterns, letting frameworks help you, having refactoring habits, and of course maintain some human-friendly documentation, for example, become really important.
