      <description>At IXDS I have the opportunity to contribute to top emerging design projects by helping make UX concepts tangible.
One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS is the close relationship between design and engineering â€”and one of ist most challenging aspects is the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for mid-term development at the same time.
Indeed, an often overlooked aspect of such discipline is how important good coding patterns are in order for the code base to be flexible for unexpected requirement changes.</description>
