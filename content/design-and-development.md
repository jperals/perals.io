A lot is being written these days about the relationship between design and development and how the workflow can be improved. For quite some time we have been trying to "fill the gap" between design phase and development phase. But maybe we have been overrating the static design mockup as a _source of truth_.

After some years experimenting with tools that export code from visual editing tools, it's interesting how more and more tools are coming out that do it the other way around by exporting code to visual design instead. Some examples of this are React2Sketch, Ava and the upcoming Framer X.
