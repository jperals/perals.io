According to the section _What is a Pattern?_ of the book _Learning JavaScript Design Patterns_ by Addi Osmani: [https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#whatisapattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#whatisapattern)

So, _if_ selecting by class, this

```
const listItems = list.getElementsByTagName('list-item');
```

would be preferable to

```js
const listItems = list.querySelector('.list-item');
```
