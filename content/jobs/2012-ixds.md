At IXDS I have the opportunity to contribute to bleeding edge projects by making UX concepts tangible.

One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS is the close relationship between [design and engineering](design-and-development) —and one of ist most challenging aspects is the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for mid-term development at the same time.
