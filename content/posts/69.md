If you try to do just `git push` a Git branch that is new and not in the remote yet, you get this message, which suggests that you need some extra arguments:

```
fatal: The current branch new-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin new-branch

```

That command can be shortened with `-u` instead of `--set-upstream`:

```
git push -u origin new-branch
```

But it's even possible to avoid typing the branch name by replacing it by the `HEAD` variable (if you are currently on that branch):

```
git push -u origin HEAD
```
