When it comes to name files and directories, kebab-case should have the following advantages over camelCase:

- Easier to type: no need to hold one key while typing another
- More readable: words are more clearly separated
- No problems for non case-sensitive file systems or configurations

However, camelCase seems to have become the standard for naming files in frontend. Why is that? Maybe because of "convention contamination" from JavaScript? Does anyone have other, maybe more solid, reasons for that?
