This:
```js
[1, 2, 3, 10].sort()
```
outputs this:
```js
[1, 10, 2, 3]
```
because apparently, elements are converted to strings before comparing them.

To compare numbers correctly, we can use a compare function:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 10].sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
which will output what we would expect:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 10]
```
