Having been involved in a variety of projects at IXDS, my role usually consists of using web technologies to bring design ideas to life, be it end-user <em>web applications</em> or <em>high-fidelity prototypes</em> for any kind of demonstrators, user testing or MVPs.

Most of the time my work is focus on the frontend side, but sometimes a full stack is involved,usually using either Python or NodeJS in the backend.

One of the most interesting aspects of my work at IXDS is the close relationship between design and engineering —and one of ist most challenging aspects is the need to work in quick iterations while allowing for long term development at the same time.
